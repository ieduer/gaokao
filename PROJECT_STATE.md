# Project State

Last updated: 2026-08-16 PDT
Current version: production deployment `51d51a51-db3f-4620-9c1d-bfbe813cd421` from pushed commit `3a36588`
Current objective: publish the complete simplified-Chinese 2026 Beijing Chinese paper and every mapped question group without carrying canonical historical dirty changes
Completed work: added a hash-bound, no-reformat importer and validator in commit `31c0bd8`; added nine components and 26 selectable prompts with OpenAI Codex (GPT-5) answers in data commit `fafd4e5`; fixed grouped questions 14 and 15 plus fail-closed validation in `3a36588`; repeated import is a byte-identical no-op
Pending work: merge draft PR #10 after the operator's normal review; no production content work remains for this release
Known problems: the canonical `/Users/ylsuen/CF/gaokao` worktree contains historical unrelated dirty files and remains excluded from release
Next recommended task: preserve the isolated release worktree until PR #10 is reviewed; never deploy the canonical dirty checkout
